# Biopython
Biopython is an open-source and powerful programming toolkit specifically designed for computational biology and bioinformatics. Developed in Python, it provides a comprehensive set of tools and libraries to facilitate the manipulation, analysis, and interpretation of biological data.

*Seq Module*:

Generating new sequences

Accessing the sequences

Length of sequences

Concatinating\Adding two or more sequences

Changing the case of the sequences

Transcription (DNA to RNA)

Translation (RNA to Protein)

Reverse complement

Reverse complement RNA

Actual code to all these topics with examples: [Seq_module code](https://github.com/usamapakhtar/biopython/blob/main/Seq_module.py)

Slicing (Subset of the sequence)

Find Functions (Find the Nucleotide bases)

Count Method (Nucleotide Bases count method)

Find Method (Find a specific combination of bases in sequence)
